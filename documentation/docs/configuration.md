# Configuration
Most of the web applications integrating the MonkJs SDK will need the same configuration properties. To simplify the
syntax when configuring your app, we provide a TypeScript interface called `CaptureAppConfig` that contains the usual
configuration properties needed. You can create a file in your app that will contain the MonkJs configuration, so that
it will be easy to modify the config properties if needed:

```typescript
import { CaptureAppConfig } from '@monkvision/types';

export const MonkJsConfig: CaptureAppConfig = {
  ...
};
```

This configuration object can then be passed to components like `<MonkAppStateProvider>` or `<PhotoCapture>`.

## Available Configuration Options
The following table lists the available configuration options in the `CaptureAppConfig` interface :

## Live Configs
MonkJs will soon offer a way to set up live configurations in your web applications that will allow you to configure the
SDK on the go without having to re-deploy your app. This feature is still in development.
