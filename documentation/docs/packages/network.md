# network
Authentication, API and other network utilities used in the MonkJs SDK and applications.

![npm latest package](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@monkvision/network/latest.svg)

## Overview
This package provides tools utilities used to communicate with the Monk back-end API. It is used both internally in the
MonkJs SDK, and externally by allowing developers using our SDK to easily communicate with our API and synchronize the
local Monk state with the distant state.

## Complete Documentation
As every other package in the SDK, please refer to
[its README file](https://github.com/monkvision/monkjs/blob/main/packages/network/README.md) for a complete
documentation on how this package works.
