# sentry
![npm latest package](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@monkvision/sentry/latest.svg)

## Overview
This package provides an implementation of the monitoring abstraction layers exposed by the
[monitoring package](docs/packages/monitoring.md) using the [Sentry](https://sentry.io/) monitoring platform. Sentry is
the platform used internally by Monk to monitor and debug our applications. Unless you already have your own monitoring
platform, and you really don't want to add Sentry as a dependency in your app, we highly recommend installing this
monitoring adapter in your app.

## Complete Documentation
As every other package in the SDK, please refer to
[its README file](https://github.com/monkvision/monkjs/blob/main/packages/sentry/README.md) for a complete
documentation on how this package works.
