# posthog
Posthog implementation used to analyze MonkJs SDK and applications.

![npm latest package](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@monkvision/posthog/latest.svg)

## Overview
This package provides an implementation of the analytics abstraction layers exposed by the
[analytics package](docs/packages/analytics.md) using the [Posthog](https://posthog.com/) analytics platform. Posthog is
the platform used internally by Monk to analyze the user's behaviour in our applications. Unless you already have your own analytics
platform, and you really don't want to add Posthog as a dependency in your app, we highly recommend installing this
analytics adapter in your app.

## Complete Documentation
As every other package in the SDK, please refer to
[its README file](https://github.com/monkvision/monkjs/blob/main/packages/posthog/README.md) for a complete
documentation on how this package works.
