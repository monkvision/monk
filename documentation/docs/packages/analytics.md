# analytics
Monk analytics abstraction package.

![npm latest package](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@monkvision/analytics/latest.svg)

## Overview
This package provides an abstraction layer for the analytics features in the MonkJs ecosystem. If you plan on using any
of these features, you can use this package to properly set up the analytics inside your application.

In the MonkJs SDK, we use this "abstraction" package as a way of offering the possibility to developers to choose their
own Analytics tools and platform if they don't want to use Posthog (the platform used internally by Monk).

## Complete Documentation
As every other package in the SDK, please refer to
[its README file](https://github.com/monkvision/monkjs/blob/main/packages/analytics/README.md) for a complete
documentation on how this package works.
