# inspection-report-web
Single page components to help you visualize and edit Monk inspection reports.

## Overview
This package exports a single page component for React (Web) called InspectionReport that displays the results of an
inspection that was previously done by Monk. It allows the user to preview the results (see the damage severities, the
inspection pictures...) and edit these results (add, remove and edit damages). It also offers the possibility to
validate the report and download it as a PDF file.

## Complete Documentation
As every other package in the SDK, please refer to
[its README file](https://github.com/monkvision/monkjs/blob/main/packages/inspection-report-web/README.md) for a
complete documentation on how this package works.
