# common-ui-web
Shared ReactJs components used in the MonkJs SDK and web applications.

![npm latest package](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@monkvision/common-ui-web/latest.svg)

## Overview
This package exports reusable UI components for React web application. These components are used throughout the
different MonkJs SDK and web application.

These package is mostly used internally only, as a way for us to store shared UI components used throughout our SDK.
This means that generally speaking, as a developer using our SDK, you won't have to directly use this component, since
you probably want to use higher level components such as the
[inspection-capture-web](docs/packages/inspection-capture-web.md)) package. But since our code is open source, feel free to
use these components in your React apps if you need them.

## Complete Documentation
As every other package in the SDK, please refer to
[its README file](https://github.com/monkvision/monkjs/blob/main/packages/common-ui-web/README.md) for a complete
documentation on how this package works.
