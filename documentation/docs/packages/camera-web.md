# camera-web
Camera implementation for taking pictures and recording videos in web.

![npm latest package](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@monkvision/camera-web/latest.svg)

## Overview
This package provides tools used to handle the Camera in MonkJs web projects in React for Web. It exports a component
called Camera, that lets you display a camera preview on your app as well as an HUD on top of it, and provides methods
to take pictures, compress images, etc.

Generally speaking, as a developer using our SDK, you won't have to directly use this component, since you probably
want to use higher level components such as the ones available in the
[inspection-capture-web](docs/packages/inspection-capture-web.md) package.

## Complete Documentation
As every other package in the SDK, please refer to
[its README file](https://github.com/monkvision/monkjs/blob/main/packages/camera-web/README.md) for a complete
documentation on how this package works.
