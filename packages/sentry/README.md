# @monkvision/sentry
This package exports a monitoring adapter that can be used to configure the monitoring of MonkJs projects using the @monkvision/monitoring project. The adapter exported by this package uses Sentry, a monitoring platform used by MonkJs to log, report errors and measure performances in its project. If you want to know more about monitoring adapters and the features they offer, please refer to the official documentation of the @monkvision/monitoring package.

# Installing
To install the package, you can run the following command :

```shell
yarn add @monkvision/monitoring @monkvision/sentry
```

If you are using TypeScript, this package comes with its type definitions integrated, so you don't need to install anything else!

# Basic Usage
## Set Up
In order to configure the sentry inside your application, you first need to instantiate the Sentry Adapter and then wrap your root component in the `MonitoringProvider` and passing it the adapter as a prop :

```typescript jsx
import { SentryMonitoringAdapter } from '@monkvision/sentry';
import { MonitoringProvider } from '@monkvision/monitoring';

const adapter = new SentryMonitoringAdapter({
  dsn: '',
  environment: '',
  debug: true / false,
  tracesSampleRate: 0.025,
  release: '',
});

const container = document.getElementById('root');
render((
  <MonitoringProvider adapter={adapter}>
    <App/>
  </MonitoringProvider>
), container);
```

# API
